# Warning

If you use this method to delete files or folders, you will not be able to recover them from the Recycle Bin.

# How to

1. Download DeleteFileWithSpace.reg
2. Open the file to import the registry keys. Now, you have a new context menu option.
3. Right-click on a file or folder which contains a trailing space and select the option "Delete file with space". The word "file" will be replaced with "folder" if you right-click on a folder.

# Caveat

Windows limits the selection of files/folders to 15 for safety reasons, i.e. to limit the impact of bad manipulations.
So you will not be able to delete more than 15 files or folders simultaneously.
